// What is leadership?
The process in which a leader and a follower interact in such a way that enables the leader to influence the actions of the follower in a non-coercive way towards the achievement of certain 
aims and objectives.
-> It is a process not a trait or characteristics.
-> leadership involves influencing others 
-> leadership happens within the context of the group
-> leadership involves goal attainment
-> these goals are shared by leader and followers

Defining leadership as process means that leadership is a transactional process that happens between leader and their follower

Manager and supervisor are the job titles but Leader is the social-psychological role of supervisor or manager

leadership can be 
1) Attempted -> leaders are putting efforts to change 
2) Successful -> behaviours of the follower is changed
3) Effective -> Both leader and follower are satisfied with the change

// How important is a leader?
In most cases people will perform at about 60% of their potential with no leadership at all. Its the remaining 40% that can be realized if the effective leadership is available.

// Approaches to leadership 
1) Scientific Management Approach 
A management philosophy concerned with increasing productivity regarded workers as extension of machines. Taylor wanted to increase the productivity by wanting worker and machines to run 
faster and more efficiently. no considerations were given to employee as human being as people with different needs, interest and ability. Labourers must be told what to do and shown how 
to do as they lack intelligence.

2) The human relation approach 
It regards the satisfaction of employee's need as a legitimate coorporate responsibility

3) Theory X and Theory Y 
Theory X
-> Most people are lazy, dislike work and avoid it
-> They must be coerced, watched and scolded
-> They have no ambition and they prefer to be led and directed
-> Management by bureaucacy
Theory Y 
-> Most people require inner satisfaction and fullfillment
-> Control and punishment is not required
-> Management by Objective

// Effective leadership depends on interaction of three factors:-
-> The traits and behaviours of the leader
-> The characteristics of the leader
-> The nature of situation in which leadership occurs 

// Leader is concerned with the interactions of three areas :-
-> task -> goal setting, methods and process
-> team -> effective interaction/communication, clarify roles, team morale
-> Individual -> attention to behaviour, feelings, coaching, CPD

// Theories of Leadership/Determinants of Leadership
