// What is leadership?
The process in which a leader and a follower interact in such a way that enables the leader to influence the actions of the follower in a non-coercive way towards the achievement of certain 
aims and objectives.
-> It is a process not a trait or characteristics.
-> leadership involves influencing others 
-> leadership happens within the context of the group
-> leadership involves goal attainment
-> these goals are shared by leader and followers

Defining leadership as process means that leadership is a transactional process that happens between leader and their follower

Manager and supervisor are the job titles but Leader is the social-psychological role of supervisor or manager

leadership can be 
1) Attempted -> leaders are putting efforts to change 
2) Successful -> behaviours of the follower is changed
3) Effective -> Both leader and follower are satisfied with the change

// How important is a leader?
In most cases people will perform at about 60% of their potential with no leadership at all. Its the remaining 40% that can be realized if the effective leadership is available.

// Approaches to leadership 
1) Scientific Management Approach 
A management philosophy concerned with increasing productivity regarded workers as extension of machines. Taylor wanted to increase the productivity by wanting worker and machines to run 
faster and more efficiently. no considerations were given to employee as human being as people with different needs, interest and ability. Labourers must be told what to do and shown how 
to do as they lack intelligence.

2) The human relation approach 
It regards the satisfaction of employee's need as a legitimate coorporate responsibility

3) Theory X and Theory Y 
Theory X
-> Most people are lazy, dislike work and avoid it
-> They must be coerced, watched and scolded
-> They have no ambition and they prefer to be led and directed
-> Management by bureaucacy
Theory Y 
-> Most people require inner satisfaction and fullfillment
-> Control and punishment is not required
-> Management by Objective

// Effective leadership depends on interaction of three factors:-
-> The traits and behaviours of the leader
-> The characteristics of the leader
-> The nature of situation in which leadership occurs 

// Leader is concerned with the interactions of three areas :-
-> task -> goal setting, methods and process
-> team -> effective interaction/communication, clarify roles, team morale
-> Individual -> attention to behaviour, feelings, coaching, CPD

// Theories of Leadership/Determinants of Leadership 
1) Traits theory of leadership / The Great Man/Women theory 
2) Behavioral Theories
3) (can't figure out)
4) Contingency Theory 
5) Hersey and Blanchard's Situational Leadership Theory

// Types of leadership Style
1) The autocratic or authoritarian leader
-> Given the power to take decisions alone, having total authority
-> Closely supervises and control people when they perform certain tasks
-> Effective in job requiring rapid decision making skills ...law enforcement and other emergency services

2) The Democratic or participative leader
-> includes one or more persons in a decision making process in determining what to do and how to do.
-> Maintains the final decision making authority 

3) The laissez-faire or delegative leader
-> Allows people to make their own decision 
-> leader is still responsible for the decision made
-> This style allows greater freedom and responsibility for people
-> However, you need competent people around you or nothing will get done 

4) Transactional Leadership
-> focuses on social interaction or exchanges between leader and followers
-> belive that they must act with accordance with what their followers except of them
-> Conduct their business by identifying the needs of their followers and bestowing rewards to satisfy those needs in exchange for a 
certain level of performance
-> Through reward and punishment system, transactional leaders are able to keep their followers motivated for a short term

5) Transforming/ Transformational Leadership
-> rather than following the needs and expectations of the followers, transformational leaders transforms the need of the followers and 
redirect thier thinking
-> In its ideal form, it creates valuable and positive change in the followers by changing them into leaders
