// Johari window
The Johari Window is a psychological tool developed by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in 1955. It is used to help 
individuals understand their relationships with themselves and others. The model is especially useful in self-awareness, personal 
development, and improving communication within groups. The Johari Window is divided into four quadrants or panes, each representing 
different aspects of self-awareness and interpersonal relationships:

### 1. **Open Area (Arena)**
- **Description**: This quadrant represents what is known by the individual about themselves and is also known by others.
- **Examples**: Your name, job title, interests, skills, and other things that both you and others are aware of.
- **Significance**: Increasing the size of this area generally leads to more effective communication and stronger relationships.

### 2. **Blind Area (Blind Spot)**
- **Description**: This area contains information about you that others know but you are unaware of.
- **Examples**: Habits, body language, or certain personality traits that others notice but you may not be conscious of.
- **Significance**: Reducing the blind spot through feedback from others can improve self-awareness.

### 3. **Hidden Area (Façade)**
- **Description**: This quadrant includes information that you know about yourself but choose to keep hidden from others.
- **Examples**: Private feelings, fears, insecurities, or past experiences that you don’t share with others.
- **Significance**: Reducing this area by sharing relevant information can enhance trust and openness in relationships.

### 4. **Unknown Area**
- **Description**: This area consists of information that neither you nor others are aware of. It represents unknown talents, feelings, 
or untapped potential.
- **Examples**: Hidden capabilities, subconscious motivations, or repressed memories.
- **Significance**: Exploration and discovery, sometimes through self-reflection or feedback, can help reduce this area.

### Visual Representation:
The Johari Window is often depicted as a four-quadrant grid:

```
               Known to Self            Unknown to Self
               
Known to Others  |      Open Area       |   Blind Area
                 |    (Arena)           |   (Blind Spot)
                 |----------------------|----------------
Unknown to Others|      Hidden Area     |   Unknown Area
                 |    (Façade)          |   (Unknown)
```

### Application:

- **Self-Reflection**: Helps individuals reflect on their own behavior, motivations, and how they are perceived by others.
- **Feedback**: Encourages the sharing of feedback to reduce the blind spot and increase self-awareness.
- **Team Building**: Facilitates better understanding and communication within teams, leading to more effective collaboration.

By working on increasing the "Open Area" through self-disclosure and feedback, individuals and teams can improve communication, trust, 
and interpersonal relationships.
